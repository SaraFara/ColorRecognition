# ColorRecognition
This project involves training a neural network to distinguish single-color images of different shades, like blue, green, red, yellow, black, and white. Using PyTorch, a dataset of categorized color images is utilized. The project also explores the network's resilience by introducing noise to images and observing its effect on performance.
